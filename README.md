# ABoringTimer
A simple timer with some nice music
Add your own music in a folder called music and then edit line 8 in timer.js.
Then simply just run open_html.sh with
```
chmod +x open_html.sh
./openhtml.sh
```
or you could make an alias with
```
alias openhtml='./openhtml.sh'
```
**Remember to change your path to index.html in the open_html.sh script**
